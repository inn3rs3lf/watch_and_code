A Todo app through Watch and Code
This will be a simple Todo app through Gordon Zhu's teaching from watchandcode.com

After having some issues staying focused with the fundementals during other courses, I have decided to try the whole "learn by doing" approach. 
With Todo lists being the first type of app the majority of coding teachers, teach, I felt this would be the best fit. 
After this hase been completed, I will then go to the other courses again with a better understanding of why we are learning what we are learning, 
and grow from there.
